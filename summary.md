Beautify Berlin is a web application that helps turn electric boxes to pieces of art. Using AI and machine learning algorithms, the web application enables users to apply for art projects to transform unpleasant-looking items into artwork, which residents and visitor enjoy looking at. Whereas users can apply for projects and provide feedback on other's proposals, the city authority can use the web application to receive and approve ideas which contribute to the beatification of Berlin.
