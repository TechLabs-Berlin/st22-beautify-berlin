# WHY are we doing this?
We want to beautify ugly places in Berlin.

# WHO are we doing it for?
We are doing this for three user groups:
- **Owners** are the legal proprietors of a place. A place could be anything: electric boxes, walls, doors, shops, stones, steps, ...
- **Designers** are people who want to paint a place.
- **Citizens** living in the neighbourhood and want to have influence on the decision of the artwork. 

# What VALUE will it provide?
- **Owners** will get a beautification of their property.
- **Designers** will get recognition and *money **(?)***.
- **Citizens** will get a more beautiful neighborhood.

# How will we MEASURE success?
***(?)***


# What can we realistically do?
We could build a platform to bring together the three user groups.
