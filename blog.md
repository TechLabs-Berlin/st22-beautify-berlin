## Deep Learning track

### Challenges
At the onset of the project, there was no clear definition for a deep learning application. Moreover, the dataset referenced in the project was not suitable to train a DL or ML model on. For about three weeks, there was no specific task identified for the DL track. Also, the project kicked off with two DL techies, and only one would complete it.

### Solutions
Better late than never: the project team finally came up with an idea. A DL model was to be developed to classify user submitted images of electric boxes into one of these categories: art, poster, dirty, clean.
